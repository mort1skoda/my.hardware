Walkthrough of creating and deleting an environment variable in Bash:

Test if the DUALCASE variable exists (empty output):

env | grep DUALCASE

It does not, so create the variable and export it:

DUALCASE=1
export DUALCASE

Check if it is there:

env | grep DUALCASE

Output:

    DUALCASE=1

It is there. So get rid of it:

unset DUALCASE

Check if it's still there (empty output):

env | grep DUALCASE

The DUALCASE exported environment variable is deleted.
